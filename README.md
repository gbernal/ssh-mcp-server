SSH-based MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that allows remote execution of SSH commands via the MCP protocol.

English Document | [‰∏≠ÊñáÊñáÊ°£](README_CN.md)

## üìù Project Overview

ssh-mcp-server is a bridging tool that enables AI assistants and other applications supporting the MCP protocol to execute remote SSH commands through a standardized interface. This allows AI assistants to safely operate remote servers, execute commands, and retrieve results without directly exposing SSH credentials to AI models.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **üîí Secure Connections**: Supports multiple secure SSH connection methods, including password authentication and private key authentication (with passphrase support)
- **üõ°Ô∏è Command Security Control**: Precisely control the range of allowed commands through flexible blacklist and whitelist mechanisms to prevent dangerous operations
- **üîÑ Standardized Interface**: Complies with MCP protocol specifications for seamless integration with AI assistants supporting the protocol
- **üìÇ File Transfer**: Supports bidirectional file transfers, uploading local files to servers or downloading files from servers
- **üîë Credential Isolation**: SSH credentials are managed entirely locally and never exposed to AI models, enhancing security
- **üöÄ Ready to Use**: Can be run directly using NPX without global installation, making it convenient and quick to deploy

```

#### üîë Using Password

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ssh-mpc-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@fangjunjie/ssh-mcp-server",
        "--host 192.168.1.1",
        "--port 22",
        "--username root",
        "--password pwd123456"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### üîê Using Private Key

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ssh-mpc-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@fangjunjie/ssh-mcp-server",
        "--host 192.168.1.1",
        "--port 22",
        "--username root",
        "--privateKey ~/.ssh/id_rsa"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### üîè Using Private Key with Passphrase

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ssh-mpc-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@fangjunjie/ssh-mcp-server",
        "--host 192.168.1.1",
        "--port 22",
        "--username root",
        "--privateKey ~/.ssh/id_rsa",
        "--passphrase pwd123456"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### üåê Using SOCKS Proxy

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ssh-mpc-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@fangjunjie/ssh-mcp-server",
        "--host 192.168.1.1",
        "--port 22",
        "--username root",
        "--password pwd123456",
        "--socksProxy socks://username:password@proxy-host:proxy-port"
      ]
    }
  }
}

```

#### üìù Using Command Whitelist and Blacklist

Use the `--whitelist` and `--blacklist` parameters to restrict the range of executable commands. Multiple patterns are separated by commas. Each pattern is a regular expression used to match commands.

Example: Using Command Whitelist

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ssh-mpc-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@fangjunjie/ssh-mcp-server",
        "--host 192.168.1.1",
        "--port 22",
        "--username root",
        "--password pwd123456",
        "--whitelist ^ls( .*)?,^cat .*,^df.*"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Example: Using Command Blacklist

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ssh-mpc-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@fangjunjie/ssh-mcp-server",
        "--host 192.168.1.1",
        "--port 22",
        "--username root",
        "--password pwd123456",
        "--blacklist ^rm .*,^shutdown.*,^reboot.*"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

> Note: If both whitelist and blacklist are specified, the system will first check whether the command is in the whitelist, and then check whether it is in the blacklist. The command must pass both checks to be executed.

### üß© Multi-SSH Connection Example

You can specify multiple SSH connections by passing multiple --ssh parameters, each with a unique name:

```bash
npx @fangjunjie/ssh-mcp-server \
  --ssh "name=dev,host=1.2.3.4,port=22,user=alice,password=xxx" \
  --ssh "name=prod,host=5.6.7.8,port=22,user=bob,password=yyy"
```

In MCP tool calls, specify the connection name via the `connectionName` parameter. If omitted, the default connection is used.

Example (execute command on 'prod' connection):

```json
{
  "tool": "execute-command",
  "params": {
    "cmdString": "ls -al",
    "connectionName": "prod"
  }
}
```

Example (execute command with timeout options):

```json
{
  "tool": "execute-command",
  "params": {
    "cmdString": "ping -c 10 127.0.0.1",
    "connectionName": "prod",
    "timeout": 5000
  }
}
```

### ‚è±Ô∏è Command Execution Timeout

The `execute-command` tool supports timeout options to prevent commands from hanging indefinitely:

- **timeout**: Command execution timeout in milliseconds (optional, default is 30000ms)

This is particularly useful for commands like `ping`, `tail -f`, or other long-running processes that might block execution.

### üóÇÔ∏è List All SSH Servers

You can use the MCP tool `list-servers` to get all available SSH server configurations:

Example call:

```json
{
  "tool": "list-servers",
  "params": {}
}
```

Example response:

```json
[
  { "name": "dev", "host": "1.2.3.4", "port": 22, "username": "alice" },
  { "name": "prod", "host": "5.6.7.8", "port": 22, "username": "bob" }
]
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

This server provides powerful capabilities to execute commands and transfer files on remote servers. To ensure it is used securely, please consider the following:

- **Command Whitelisting**: It is *strongly recommended* to use the `--whitelist` option to restrict the set of commands that can be executed. Without a whitelist, any command can be executed on the remote server, which can be a significant security risk.
- **Private Key Security**: The server reads the SSH private key into memory. Ensure that the machine running the `ssh-mcp-server` is secure. Do not expose the server to untrusted networks.
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: The server does not have built-in rate limiting. An attacker could potentially launch a DoS attack by flooding the server with connection requests or large file transfers. It is recommended to run the server behind a firewall or reverse proxy with rate-limiting capabilities.
- **Path Traversal**: The server has built-in protection against path traversal attacks on the local filesystem. However, it is still important to be mindful of the paths used in `upload` and `download` commands.
